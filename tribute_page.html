        <p class="bio" id="bio-name"><strong>Eugene Bullard</strong><br><br>
        Horse jockey, prize fighting boxer, Jazz musician, soldier, spy, fighter pilot.
          </p>
        <p class="bio">As an African-American living in Georgia, Bullard experienced rampant racism that plagued the Deep South. One incident involving his father proved to be the catalyst that spurred Bullard to escape the throes of racial hate. Having witnessed a mob of white supremacists attempt to lynch his father, a young Eugene vowed to escape his hellish reality by escaping the United States and settling in France - a Utopian France that Eugene's father often spoke of, where Black men and White men lived in harmony as equals.

        </p>
        <p class="bio">Bullard made history by becoming the first African-American to fly as a fighter pilot. However, Bullard did not fly for the United States - he flew for France. Bullard served with distinction in WWI and WWII, and acquired many medals for his exploits during both wars.
