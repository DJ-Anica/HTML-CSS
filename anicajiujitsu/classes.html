                <p id="class-text">Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art that is practiced in a gi, and is designed to apply leverage and momentum through a system of techniques, that can allow a smaller or weaker practitioner to defeat a larger opponent.<br>
                    It is an art form that consists primarily of grappling techniques, and aims to bring an opponent to the ground, and subdue or submit them, while taking as little damage as possible.</p>

                <p id="class-text">Traditionally, Jiu-Jitsu is practiced in a gi, or kimono.<br>However, the rise of MMA and professional no-gi competitions have given more popularity to practicing jiu-jitsu without a gi on.<br>
                    We find that both styles are enjoyable and equally applicable in self defense and competition scenarios, so we practice both!</p>
